## **K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation**

This project implements the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. By analyzing customer data, such as frequency of purchase, total spend, and product preferences, the algorithm groups customers into clusters that exhibit similar purchasing behaviors. 

The process involves:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and selecting relevant attributes for clustering.
2. **K-Means Algorithm**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to identify optimal customer segments. The number of clusters (K) is determined using methods such as the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score**.
3. **Visualization**: Visualizing the clusters using scatter plots to interpret the results and provide actionable insights.

The outcome helps businesses understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly, offering personalized promotions to different customer segments.
